# What is this
This is a package for writing differential programs (i.e. neural networks) in
rust. I'll actually publish it to crates.io once I get a few canonical examples
working, such as RNNs.

* Check out the example `cargo run --example mnist --release`!
* Check out documentation `cargo doc --open`
* Please give me feedback
